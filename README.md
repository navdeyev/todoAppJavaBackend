## TodoAppJavaBackend

This is a Java-based backend for the TodoApp project.
My initial goals are to familiarize myself with:

    - Spring Boot
    - H2 in-memory database and JPA 
    - Liquibase concepts

At the moment the app creates an H2 database on startup and initializes 
it with necessary tables and some data defined in `liquibase-changelog.xml`.
